WMNut
=====

Description
-----------

WMNut is a program to monitor multiple UPS devices' statistics through the NUT
(link:http://www.networkupstools.org[Network UPS Tools]) framework on Linux
and other systems.

It is a dockapp that is supported natively by X window managers such as
Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, FluxBox, and Enlightenment.

WMNut will run as a simple 64*64 pixels window in other Window Managers, or
when using *-w*.

WMNut provides multiple UPS's monitoring with:

- Status of power supply (battery or AC Power),
- Communication status with UPS (Red/Green "C"),
- Percentage of battery remaining (numeric and meter),
- Load level percentage on output (numeric, if available),
- Runtime to empty, i.e. time left to battery depletion (MM:SS),
- High/Low/Critical battery status (Red/Yellow/Green colored meter and battery).

It is known to run on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OpenIndiana (based on
illumos/Solaris), but should also run on any other system supporting X11.

Like NUT, it may require C99 or newer compiler support.

WMNut releases.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

WMNut requires the:

- X Window client and Xpm libraries and development files.
  * For example on a Debian GNU/Linux system, you need to install the packages
    `libxext-dev` and `libxpm-dev`; other systems may have this without `-dev`
    suffix, or other suffixes like `-devel`.
  * If `X11/X.h` is not found, see if you have `xorgproto` package.
- NUT client library, version 2.8.0 or higher.
  * For example on a Debian GNU/Linux system, you need to install the package
    `libupsclient-dev` (note that some stable distributions still ship older
    NUT v2.7.4 based packages!)
  * WMNut may actually still work with 2.4.0 or higher -- but at the expense
    of build warnings with data type mismatches and some needed tweaks of the
    `configure.ac` script and possibly wmnut codebase itself.
    It may be easier to just take wmnut-0.67 or an older release then.

In order to compile WMNut using the `Makefile`, GNU `make` should be used.

NOTE: For FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OpenIndiana users, the default BSD `make` or
Sun `dmake` programs respectively in modern releases (2020's) do also work
for the simple recipes used here; however in case of reported `Makefile`
syntax problems -- remember to try using `gmake` instead!

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Download WMNut source code (from GitHub) or archive (`.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2`)

Either get an archive file from
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut/releases[WMNut releases on GitHub]
or clone the git repository using:

	$ git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut.git

2) Uncompress the archive (not needed for github source code)

	$ tar -zxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.gz
	$ tar -jxvf wmnut-X.YZ.tar.bz2

3) Switch to WMNut source code directory

	$ cd wmnut-X.YZ

If you are using the git source code, use:

	$ cd wmnut

4) Prepare the source for building

[NOTE]
================================================================================
when using the git repository, be sure to first call:

	$ autoreconf -i

It is also wrapped into a simple `autogen.sh` script for consistency
with other NUT source code repositories.
================================================================================

Just call the usual:

	$ ./configure

[NOTE]
================================================================================
WMNut now uses `pkg-config` to determine the location of NUT library and
headers by default. Alternatively, you can point to systems-dependent
location of a custom NUT build or installation (`make install DESTDIR=...`)
area, like this:

	NUT_LIBS="-L${HOME}/nut/clients/.libs -lupsclient" \
	NUT_CFLAGS="-I${HOME}/nut/include -I${HOME}/nut/clients" \
	./configure
	
	# You would need to install that libdir or pass it with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	# to run the built program experimentally, e.g.:
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/nut/clients/.libs ./src/wmnut -w
================================================================================

5) Now compile WMNut

	$ make

Or (may be needed for *BSD and Solaris/illumos based systems):

	$ gmake

6) And install it on your system

Use the following command, as `root` (or using `sudo`):

	$ make install

Or simply copy the `wmnut` binary (and optionally its manual page) to the
right directories on your system.

7) Optionally, configure WMNut for your own use

WMNut will automatically connect to any local device(s).

So if you have remote system(s) that you want to monitor, edit and adapt your
`wmnutrc` file . Then copy it to your user home directory and/or to your system
`/etc` directory, using commands like:

	$ cp wmnutrc /etc/wmnutrc

and/or:

	$ cp wmnutrc ~/.wmnutrc

[NOTE]
================================================================================
- as of WMNut 0.65, `wmnutrc` is installed now, to `/etc` by default
- if both files exist, `~/.wmnutrc` takes precedence,
- command line options take precedence over configuration files,
- on Debian, a sample `wmnutrc` is located in `/usr/share/doc/wmnut/`.
================================================================================

8) Launch WMNut

	$ wmnut &

You can also use `wmnut -h` for help, or `man wmnut` to access the manual page.

If no parameter is given, wmnut will try to access the UPS at "localhost"
address. Otherwise try `wmnut -U upsname@hostname` or edit your `wmnutrc` files.

Be sure to read the `HINTS` and `TODO` files too!

  Note that Arnaud had also taken over NUT leadership since 2005 to 2020.
- Bill Richter, Laszlo Hazy and David Butts for their support in beta test
  and improvement of WMNut,
- Martijm Pieterse and Antoine Nulle for a great (and somewhat standardized)
  interface which Arnaud used as a template (`wmmon.app` and `wmgeneral`),
- Luca Filipozzi for WMNut Debian package creation, later maintained by Arnaud,
  available at link:http://packages.debian.org/wmnut[Debian website].


Help
----
We are interested in having feedback about how WMNut runs on other platforms
(BSD, Solaris, ...) and searching for packagers on those platforms.

If you have nice suggestions, ideas, whatever, that are not
on TODO list, feel free to post issues and pull requests at
https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut/releases

You can also try the NUT community support channels, as detailed at
https://networkupstools.org/support.html

FAQ
---

(How) Does WMNut support multiple UPS monitoring?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, WMNut can monitor up to 9 UPSs since release 0.1. Take a look at `HINTS`
file and manual page for more details about using this feature.

Can I set the initial size of WMNut?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, WMNut is limited to 64*64.

I'm not running WindowMaker nor AfterStep. How can I run WMNut in windowed mode (i.e. not having transparent background !)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try running `wmnut -w`. See below for a screenshot.

I can't compile WMNut ("undefined reference to `upslogx'", "upsfetch.h/o not found" or "upsclient.h/o not found") or WMNut doesn't work!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is always lots of improvements in both NUT and WMNut...

To solve your problem, you should upgrade to the most current release of NUT
and WMNut, and the problem should disappear -- it was solved in the past.
