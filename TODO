TODO list for WMNUT
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note: WMNut is no more evolving, though still maintained. This means that
the TODO list items below will probably never get implemented.

Planned for 0.60.0
	* Add install-conf rule to Makefile for wmnutrc

Planned for 0.70.0
	* Status overview (9 R/G/B/none LED) between arrows and panel

Planned for 0.80.0
	* Page 0 dedicated as a "launcher" page (to call wmnut configuration
		GUI, or external application)

Planned for 0.90.0
	* wmnut configuration GUI to ease user configuration,

Planned for 1.0.0
	* Above and below features, no bugs and no user request pending.

Not scheduled yet or backgrounded:	

	* autoconf for getopt: EOF (Solaris) vs. -1 (HP-UX, AIX)
	* Derivate a gkrellm applet (or include an option)
	* Validate and enhance other platforms support (FreeBSD,
	  NetBSD, Solaris and other NUT supported platforms),
	  and other window managers support
	* Add an option to choose between battery load in bargraph
	  or with a battery (asapm style)
	or Themability (skins !)
	* Nice logo.
	* Background color option
	* Enlarge border in windowed mode to facilitate window moving
	* consider creating /var/run/wmnut.pid (for fixing multi instance pb)
	* Add setitimer to flush_expose() to deal with no X11 events

Abandoned features
	* Derivate a gnome / kde applet (or include an option). This is part
		of other projects.
	* dynamically reread rcfiles files on SIGUSR1
